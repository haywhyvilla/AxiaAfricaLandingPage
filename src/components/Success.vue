          I had no clue where to start in learning Product design, then Axia
          Africa started an online training and I joined. Within few weeks of
          coaching I was able to understand both UX &amp; UI. The classes are
          interesting and gives room to ask questions. Materials provided were
          helpful.&nbsp;It was a great to learning experience led by the
          fantastic teachers. I would highly recommend this training if you are
          a beginner

          Axia Africa’s product design class has been an eye opener and a good
          starter for me as someone who is a graphic designer but struggles a
          lot with UX in particular. I’ve become more confident in my UX process
          and prowess as a designer and I won’t stop learning!. Thank you Axia.

          Axia Africa has been so helpful to me. I got into tech with zero
          knowledge of it, didn’t even know my way around a good system. But
          right now, I know more than I would’ve imagined that I can before I
          got into the academy. Very helpful, kind, patient and thoughtful
          teachers too.&nbsp;This training has really helped me! I highly
          recommend it! Thank youuu.

          Being someone with the passion to learn design, I found it hard to
          multitask between my days job and my passion for learning. Coupled
          with this, the fear of learning alone without mentorship made me doubt
          my ability to learn ui/ux. However, thanks to Axia Africa and their
          mentorship programs, I have been able to learn what I desired to learn
          in a convenient space at my own pace. Thanks Axia Africa
